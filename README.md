## FAQ

**Q: What minecraft versions do you support?**

A: At the time of writing this modpack supports both 1.20.1 and 1.20.4

**Q: Okay, but what minecraft version do you recommend we play this modpack on?**

A: Since not all mods have updated (yet), if you want the fullest experience we recommend you play it on 1.20.1

**Q: Can I use shaders?**

A: We don't reccomend using this modpack with shaders, because it can result in some weird artifacting on the pony models, however if you really, really, want to, you can add [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) separately.

**Q: Can I use this modpack on my server?**

A: Yes! You can use this modpack for your personal server. Public servers are allowed provided they follow mojang's EULA and do not feature any pay-to-win, pay-to-play, or loot-box/gambling mechanics.

**Q: I use arch btw**

A: Good for you! Next question?

**Q: Is this a pyramid scheme?**

A: No, this is a modpack.
